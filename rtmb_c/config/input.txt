# ************ EDIT THIS FILE IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING **************
#
# This is the input configuration file that the micro-benchmark uses for execution.
# Each micro-benchmark test will have an entry similar to this:
#
# test
# name=XXX
# desc=XXXXXX
# iterations=XXXX
# config_test=X
# reference_score=XXXXXXX
# threshold=X
# /test
# 
# Each test entry start is represented by the keyword 'test' and the end of config
# paramaters for a test is represented by '/test'.
#
# The key-value pair - "name=XXX" represents the micro-benchmark name. The main function/class
# that is implementing this micro-benchmark also carries the same name in the source code. 
# So, any changes to this key-value pair should carry changes in the source code as well.
# Else, you may end up getting test failures.
#
# The key-value pair - "desc=XXXXXX" describes the micro-benchmark briefly.
#
# The next key-value pair is - "iteration=XXXX". This is used to calculate the total number of
# iterations that the micro-benchmark needs to run for. The total number of iterations run by a 
# micro-benchmark is equal to the product of iteration and the multiplier value 
# (eg: hard.multiplier,soft.multiplier) specified at the bottom of this config file. 
#
# The next key-value pair is - "config_test=X". This is a boolean and if true (1) it indicates 
# that the test is a configuration test and not a micro-benchmark. If this is false, then the
# test is not a config test. A config test is the test that will always run first, to determine 
# the capabilities of the system. For example - the accuracy of the system clock, timer etc. 
# The output of this will be used by other micro-benchmarks for their operations.
#
# The next key-value pair is - "reference_score=XXXXXXX". This is the score that a reference
# machine produced for the micro-benchmark test. This is used to come up with the final score 
# of micro-benchmark and for the system.
#
# The next key-value pair is - "threshold=X". For every micro-benchmark run, there is a check
# if the results are within the acceptable variance; if not, then the micro-benchmark is retried. 
#
# Towards the end of this file, the "acceptable" and "range" percentages for each of the test
# execution modes is given.
#
# For eg.:
#
# soft.acceptable_percentage=99
#
# This means the acceptable percentage for "--soft-rt" execution mode is 99%. 
# 
# soft.range_percentage=50
# 
# This means the range percentage for "--soft-rt" execution mode is 50%.
#
# Finally, it means that 99% of all iterations should complete within +/- 50% of the value at
# the median. If an execution of a micro-benchmark does not meet this criteria, it is retried
# for 'threshold' number of times.
#
# Likewise, the default acceptable and range percentages for "--hard-rt" and "--guaranteed-rt"
# are provided.
