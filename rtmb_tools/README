Simple tools are in this directory.

Right now, it is just 2 tools to produce a plot on Linux.

If you run one of the RTMB programs and generate a report directory, 
you can get a graphical view of the data as follows:

For a Histogram plot:
-Assume the report file you want a graphical view of is called c_report_090713_223651290/lock_consistency/report.txt
-Also assume you want a postscript plot file in lock_consistency.ps

-Set your CLASSPATH to point to the com.ibm.realtime.rtmb.tools.Histogram.class file, 
 e.g. export CLASSPATH=/home/fultonm/rtmb_tools/bin
-Set your PATH to point to the RTMB tools  directory, 
 e.g. export PATH=/home/fultonm/rtmb_tools:$PATH
 
-java com.ibm.realtime.rtmb.tools.Histogram <c_report_090713_223651290/lock_consistency/report.txt | histogram "Plot Label" >lock_consistency.ps

For an Execution-Time plot:
-Assume the report file you want a graphical view of is called java_report_090713_223651290/CompilationTest/report.txt
-Also assume you want a postscript plot file in CompilationTest.ps

-Set your CLASSPATH to point to the com.ibm.realtime.rtmb.tools.ExecutionTime.class file, 
 e.g. export CLASSPATH=/home/fultonm/rtmb_tools/bin
-Set your PATH to point to the RTMB tools  directory, 
 e.g. export PATH=/home/fultonm/rtmb_tools:$PATH
 
-java com.ibm.realtime.rtmb.tools.ExecutionTime <java_report_090713_223651290/CompilationTest/report.txt | executionTime "Plot Label" >CompilationTest.ps
